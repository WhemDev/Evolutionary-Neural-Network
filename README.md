NeuralNetwork

This project is a simulation where agents use a neural network to learn and evolve over generations. Agents receive input from their environment, make decisions using a simple neural network, and try to survive based on predefined rules. The simulation visually tracks the development and evolution of agents over time.

Each agent is equipped with a neural network that processes environmental information and decides its actions. As generations pass, agents evolve and adapt, leading to more complex and effective behaviors.

The simulation includes a visual interface that lets you observe agent movements and behaviors in real time.
